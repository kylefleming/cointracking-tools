"""
Finds duplicate entries in cointracking.

This script is useful in detecting mistakes eg in manually added deposits/withdrawals.
However, it is quite possible that it reports many duplicate trades that naturally
occur when trading on exchanges.

You can mark a duplicate entry as acceptable by adding `dupok` to the entry's comment.

This script works on a json export as the API has rather low request limits.
